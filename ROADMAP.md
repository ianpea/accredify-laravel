## Roadmap
1. Give user a history tab to view past verifications and results. (1 day)
2. Store file name, file content blob in verifications table. (0.5 day)
3. Scale the verify() function, currently it feels like it is not scalable if new verifications are added. Not really sure how to scale it as of now. (x days)
4. More error handling on verify portion. (1 day)
5. Port the frontend to React/Vue. (>5 days)
6. Send email to user on successful verification. (2 days)
7. Logger to catch all exceptions and stack trace to a table for debug purpose. (1 day)
